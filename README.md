# Candy Distribution (Java)

This repository contains a Java solution to the classic candy distribution problem.

## How It Works

The program assigns candies to children based on their ratings:
- Each child gets at least one candy
- Children with higher ratings than neighbors get more candies

## How to Run

2. Run the program and input the number of children and their ratings

## Example


Enter number of children: 3  
Enter ratings: 1 2 2  
Total candies needed: 4 

## Features

- Interactive input using `Scanner`
- Clean logic with left-to-right and right-to-left passes
